Welcome!
This is the README file for the py-demos folder.

As the name suggests, this repository is created to keep all my Python scripts organized and in one place as I continue learning and experimenting with different concepts. The main goal is to track my progress, document what I learn, and build a structured collection of small but meaningful projects over time.

Each script or demo in this repository focuses on a specific topic, concept, or use case in Python. From basic syntax and data structures to automation, data analysis, and beyond. It serves as both a personal learning log and a reference for anyone who wants to explore similar ideas.

Thank you for checking it out.
More updates, improvements, and new demos will be added soon. Stay tuned!
